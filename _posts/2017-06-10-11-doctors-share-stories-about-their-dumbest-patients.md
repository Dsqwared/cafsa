<p style="text-align: left;">A considerable amount of a doctors&#8217; time is spent explaining things to patients and their family. They have to describe symptoms and diagnoses in a way that we will understand, but without skipping over any important details. When it comes down to these conversations, the patient is obviously going to know less than the professional; this is a dynamic doctors have to get used to.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">If doctorsÂ were to complain about every thing that a patient gets wrong, they would be exhausted. So that&#8217;s why if a doctor calls out a patient for stupidity, you can be sure that they did something monumentally idiotic. So have a read through this collection of tales of foolishness, in the words of the doctors themselves.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>1. That&#8217;s a little high</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-269037 size-full" src="http://www.viralthread.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/1-3-e1496927894156.jpg" alt="" width="634" height="145" srcset="https://www.viralthread.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/1-3-e1496927894156.jpg 634w, https://www.viralthread.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/1-3-e1496927894156-370x85.jpg 370w" sizes="(max-width: 634px) 100vw, 634px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>2. That must be one confused kitten</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-269038 size-full" src="http://www.viralthread.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/2-3-e1496927954204.jpg" alt="" width="556" height="128" srcset="https://www.viralthread.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/2-3-e1496927954204.jpg 556w, https://www.viralthread.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/2-3-e1496927954204-370x85.jpg 370w" sizes="(max-width: 556px) 100vw, 556px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>3. Playing it safe</strong></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>4. It&#8217;s in the name</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-269040 size-full" src="http://www.viralthread.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/5-maybe-e1496928000364.jpg" alt="" width="532" height="296" srcset="https://www.viralthread.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/5-maybe-e1496928000364.jpg 532w, https://www.viralthread.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/5-maybe-e1496928000364-370x206.jpg 370w" sizes="(max-width: 532px) 100vw, 532px" /></p>
