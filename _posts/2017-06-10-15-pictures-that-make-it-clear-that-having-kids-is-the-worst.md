<p>Parenting is a noble and necessary institution.</p>
<p>To many the apotheosis of a life well lived, becoming a parent is a huge decision and one that should never be taken lightly, for obvious reasons.While there is no one size fits all approach to being a good and responsible parent, there are endless handbooks on the subject, and new parents will attest that their contemporaries inundate them with advice from the moment the pregnancy is announced.</p>
<p>While parenting does seem to grant a sort of gold card to social acceptability as we get older, it clearly isn&#8217;t an institution meant for everyone. There is a certain nobility, one feels, in abstaining from the act of having children if you feel incapable of, or uncommitted to, the act of raising a child.</p>
<p>Once one does decide to take the plunge into the emollient waters of parenthood though, the real challenges begin. Baby names, baby food, nappy changing, sleepless nights; it&#8217;s a metaphorical minefield out there for new parents, and not one you would wish to navigate in an ad-hoc fashion.</p>
<p>In fact, these pictures might put you off having children for life; be warned, you may never feel the same about parenting again.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>1. When they draw portraits of you</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-269279" src="http://www.viralthread.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/parenting1.jpg" alt="" width="692" height="804" srcset="https://www.viralthread.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/parenting1.jpg 692w, https://www.viralthread.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/parenting1-318x370.jpg 318w, https://www.viralthread.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/parenting1-671x780.jpg 671w" sizes="(max-width: 692px) 100vw, 692px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>2. Or they give you the cold, hard truth</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-269283" src="http://www.viralthread.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/parenting2.jpg" alt="" width="627" height="480" srcset="https://www.viralthread.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/parenting2.jpg 627w, https://www.viralthread.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/parenting2-370x283.jpg 370w" sizes="(max-width: 627px) 100vw, 627px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>3. Even naming them will make you feel like a nasty piece of work</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-269287" src="http://www.viralthread.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/parenting3.jpg" alt="" width="683" height="258" srcset="https://www.viralthread.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/parenting3.jpg 683w, https://www.viralthread.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/parenting3-370x140.jpg 370w" sizes="(max-width: 683px) 100vw, 683px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>4. That&#8217;s enough to make me tap out</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-269290" src="http://www.viralthread.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/parenting4.jpg" alt="" width="647" height="294" srcset="https://www.viralthread.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/parenting4.jpg 647w, https://www.viralthread.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/parenting4-370x168.jpg 370w" sizes="(max-width: 647px) 100vw, 647px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>5. When even their more thoughtful moments become expensive</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-269291" src="http://www.viralthread.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/parenting5.jpg" alt="" width="778" height="580" srcset="https://www.viralthread.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/parenting5.jpg 778w, https://www.viralthread.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/parenting5-370x276.jpg 370w, https://www.viralthread.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/parenting5-768x573.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 778px) 100vw, 778px" /></p>
