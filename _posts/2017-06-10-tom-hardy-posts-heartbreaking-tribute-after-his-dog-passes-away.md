<p>Tom Hardy is a one of the most beloved actors in the world, and for good reason. He has starred in everything from blockbusters to low-budget indie dramas, and taken on every role from British spy to Batman villain. The Oscar-nominated actor is well respected as a performer and loved to bits as a celebrity.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not just his illustrious acting career that has earned him legions of fans however. There&#8217;s a certain kind of charisma and charm that comes with showing affection, so when we see celebrities with their children or showing compassion for others it always goes down a treat.</p>

<p>In the case of Tom Hardy, it was his love of dogs. There are entire blogs dedicated just to photos captured (either by the paparazzi or by the actor himself) of him spending some quality time with a canine companion. That&#8217;s how his dog Woodstock, came to be known by the public as his best friend.</p>
<p>The actor found the dog on the freeway in Atlanta, Georgia, during the filming of Lawless. After almost running him over, the cast saved the 11-week-old dog and kept him on set. After he cleared quarantine, Hardy brought him back to London. A few years later Woodstock even made it onto the red carpet for the premiere of Hardy&#8217;s film Legend. </p>
