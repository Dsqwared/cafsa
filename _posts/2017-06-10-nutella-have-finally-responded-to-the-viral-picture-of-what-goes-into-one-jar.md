<p>Whisper it quietly, but Nutella isn&#8217;t exactly the solution to all of our problems, no matter how much of it we spread and slather all over our toast, our pancakes and sometimes even our fingers.

Now, though, the company behind Nutella have addressed the viral photo, and released a statement that is sure to generate discussion.</p>
