<p>I don&#8217;t know about you, but I am more devoted to my bed than I am to any living being. When I pause to think about it, I realise that my bed has been the most committed boyfriend I could ever hope to have: it is there for me when I&#8217;m upset, it doesn&#8217;t complain about my incessant binge-watching of Netflix nor my habit of eating in bed and most importantly, I always have the final say on what movie to watch.</p>
<p>As it turns out that, there&#8217;s someone who gets where I&#8217;m coming from and that is professional YouTuber Simone Giertz. The 26-year-old Swedish native is a robot enthusiast and the proud inventor of a series of wonderfully impractical robots including a helmet that almost brushes your teeth and an alarm clock that slaps you awake. Her followers lovingly refer to her as The Queen of Shitty Robots, and it&#8217;s a fitting title.</p>

<p>However, I am intrigued by Simone&#8217;s latest invention. The premise is simple but ingenious: make a body-shaped mattress that you can strap to your back, allowing you to sleep anywhere. Giertz even has all your snuggling needs covered &#8211; she fashioned a cape that acts like a blanket once you pull it over you.</p>
