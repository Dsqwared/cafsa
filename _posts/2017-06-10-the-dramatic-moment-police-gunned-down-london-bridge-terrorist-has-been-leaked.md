<p>England has experienced a tragic few weeks. A pair of senseless attacks, spaced only two weeks apart, leave a death toll of 30, and scores of people injured. Attacks like these are designed to squash our national spirit but this makes it more necessary that we come together as a nation to emerge stronger than ever.</p>
<p>On 22th May 2017, a suicide bomber attacked Manchester&#8217;s largest music arena following a performance by pop star Ariana Grande. 22-year-old Salman Abedi detonated a homemade bomb &#8211; which was riddled with shrapnel &#8211; around the exit of the arena. This crime led to the deaths of 22 innocent adults and children and left 119 people injured, some in critical condition.</p>

<p>Less than two weeks later, the capital, London, faced another attack. On the third of June 2017, eight people were killed and 48 left injured when three attackers drove a van into pedestrians on London Bridge, before launching a knife attack at the popular dining spot of Borough Market, where tourists and locals alike were enjoying a Saturday night out in the city.</p>
<p>However, we have seen heartwarming acts that demonstrate the love and bravery of British citizens in the aftermath of the attack. One example of this was Ariana Grande&#8217;s reaction. The 23-year-old  not only spent time speaking to victims and their families but organized a tribute concert, One Love Manchester which aimed to use the power of pop music to bring the country together.</p>
<p>The same can be said of the brave policemen who arrived on the scene in just eight minutes. Dramatic footage of the police officers valiantly shooting down the attackers has been captured on camera.</p>
