<p>In 2017, the customer service reputation aboard some prominent world airlines took somewhat of a hammering.</p>
<p>In April, the world was shocked to see viral video of 69-year-old Doctor David Dao, as he was dragged kicking, screaming and humiliated, from a United Airlines flight travelling from Chicago&#8217;s O&#8217;Hare International Airport that had been overbooked. United Airlines also had to contend with heavy criticism after barring two teenage girls from boarding a flight for wearing leggings, while Delta Airlines also had to forcibly remove a family from a flight to Los Angeles.</p>

<p>Of course, in the field of customer service, it&#8217;s not uncommon for the inverse to happen, and an airline employee can be subjected to wholly unfair treatment from a passenger. That&#8217;s what unfolded in Brussels Airport, when a disgruntled passenger brutally heckled a Ryanair employee trying to do her job; his abuse bringing the worker to tears.</p>
