<p>Being a parent is far from an easy task.</p>
<p>To some an important milestone in a life well lived, others would view parenting as the ultimate stifling of one&#8217;s freedom, being something of a full time job in and of itself.</p>
<p>While parenting does seem to grant a sort of gold card to social acceptability &#8211; particularly as we get older &#8211; it clearly isn&#8217;t an institution meant for everyone. There is a certain nobility, one feels, in abstaining from the act of having children if you feel incapable of, or uncommitted to, the act of raising a child.</p>

<p>Once one does decide to take the plunge into the emollient waters of parenthood though, the real challenges begin. Baby names, baby food, nappy changing, sleepless nights; it&#8217;s a metaphorical minefield out there for new parents, with high stakes too, and not a minefield one would wish to navigate in an ad-hoc fashion.</p>
<p>We have all encountered children that, privately, we feel are likely given the run of the roost at home, permitted to run around unencumbered by social norms; generally causing a ruckus of such epic proportions it is astonishing that the parents are somehow able to blithely smile through the maelstrom without so much as a flicker of malcontent.</p>
<p>The million dollar question, then, is how to avoid a similar fate for your own children.</p>
