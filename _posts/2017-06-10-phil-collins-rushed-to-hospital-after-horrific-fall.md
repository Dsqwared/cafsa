<p>Phil Collins has been rushed to hospital &#8211; and will postpone live dates &#8211; after a dramatic fall in a hotel saw the 66-year-old singer reportedly badly cut open his head.</p>
<p>After more than 10 years rest from touring, it appears that Collins will be forced to pause upcoming shows at the Royal Albert Hall in London, according to a post on the singer&#8217;s Facebook page;</p>
<p><em>&#8220;We unfortunately have to announce that Phil Collins&#8217; performance at the Royal Albert Hall in London will be postponed tonight (June 8) and tomorrow (June 9).</em></p>

<p><em>Phil Suffers from &#8216;drop foot&#8217; as a result of a back operation which makes it difficult to walk. He rose in the middle of the night to go to the toilet and slipped in his hotel room, hitting his head in the fall on a chair.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>It seems that the postponed shows will be rearranged for November 26 and 27 later in the year, with tickets to Collins&#8217; June shows valid for the new dates.</p>
