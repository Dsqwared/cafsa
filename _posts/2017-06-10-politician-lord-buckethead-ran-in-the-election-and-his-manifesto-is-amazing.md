<p>Whatever the country, election time is one fraught with stress and hostility, as people with opposing views come together to argue and debate with one another. The British general election this year has been no different, with the Labour and Conservative parties battling for the popular vote.</p>
<p>The British Prime Minister and leader of the Conservative party Theresa May has not exactly been having the best month. After she announced the election, three years earlier than it was due to arrive, many believed her party was on track to win a large majority of the votes.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-269392" src="http://www.viralthread.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/buckethead4.jpg" alt="" width="590" height="350" srcset="https://www.viralthread.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/buckethead4.jpg 590w, https://www.viralthread.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/buckethead4-370x219.jpg 370w" sizes="(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px" /></p>
<p>Unfortunately for May, a series of unpopular decisions and campaign mishaps led to the party losing its lead in the polls. By the time the election came around on June 8, the huge lead they had was closing, with the Labour party and its leader Jeremy Corbyn hot on her heels.</p>
<p>But opposition from seasoned politicians like Corbyn was not the only thing the Prime Minister would have to face in the 2017 General Election. She had not accounted for the rival for <em>other</em> leadership: Lord Buckethead.</p>
