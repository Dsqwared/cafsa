<p>It&#8217;s highly likely that you&#8217;ve watched videos or seen photos of bull-fighting contests. The sport hails from countries such as Spain and Portugal, and also some Latin American areas. If you&#8217;re familiar with the dangerous pageant, you know that for decades criticism has been building towards the practice which is considered an art-form by some, steeped in national history for many of the countries in question.</p>
<p>The practice has been heavily condemned by animal rights activists who state that during fights bulls not only suffer from severe stress but often end up dying a slow, painful death.</p>

<p>Bullfighting, or &#8220;la corrida de toros&#8221; as it is known in Spain, normally involve the bullfighter, or &#8220;matador&#8221; taunting and frustrating a bull so much so that it reacts aggressively and runs towards the sportsman who then skillfully dodges it. The bull of course is eventually killed by the matador.</p>
<p>The BBC reports that around 2,000 bull-fights are still held every year in Spain, but numbers have been falling for years. In 2010 Catalonia banned the traditional pageant, following in the footsteps of the Canary Islands who prohibited it in 1991.</p>
<p>However, bull-fighting is still prevalent in many countries, especially in Peru, Colombia and Mexico where it is both popular and legal. Bullfighting is one cultural practice which has not been subject to too much modernisation and so severe injuries as well as deaths are not uncommon. And certainly not at the Jala Toro festival in Peru where 12 people were left injured after being gored.</p>
