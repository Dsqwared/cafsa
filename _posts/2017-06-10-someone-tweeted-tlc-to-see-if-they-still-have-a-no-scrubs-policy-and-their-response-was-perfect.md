<p>Kids growing up in the 90s knew two things beyond a shadow of a doubt; that TLC had a strict no scrubs policy, and that if you wanted to be a lover of a member of the popular girl band the Spice Girls &#8211; somewhat bizarrely &#8211; you would be required to &#8220;get with [their] friends&#8221;. Quite why that was a perquisite upon which to build a romantic liaison remains unclear.</p>

<p>It has been a long time since those two truths were first uttered, though, and much has changed in the world. The iPhone has come into being, the internet is now something of a big deal, CD Walkman&#8217;s are &#8211; regrettably &#8211; largely a thing of the past and it is no longer necessary to wind down your car window by hand (in most cases).</p>
<p>All of this dizzying social and technological advancement, then, has altered the landscape of our society forever, leading some fans to be rather concerned that TLC might have changed their no scrubs policy, in what would surely be the most polarising moment of 2017 thus far.</p>

<p>Concerned, comedian Paul F. Tompkins tweeted the question on everyone&#8217;s lips, &#8220;Does anyone know if TLC has relaxed its policy on scrubs?&#8221;. He probably wasn&#8217;t expecting to get an answer from the real life TLC themselves, but they had the perfect response.</p>
