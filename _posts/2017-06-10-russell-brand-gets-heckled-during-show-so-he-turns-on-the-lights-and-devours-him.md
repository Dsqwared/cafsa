<p>In the world of public speaking, one of the hardest things to do is to tell a joke. Not only must the punchline be absolutely perfect, but the setup, timing and even the delivery have to be spot on for maximum laughs. As a result, it doesn&#8217;t take much to throw a comedian off his or her game.</p>
<p>I haven&#8217;t yet tried standup comedy, but every time I make a pun or terrible joke in my office, the entire company groans, and it&#8217;s almost enough to make me stop making jokes altogether. Almost.</p>

<p>Standup comedians come across as charming, laid-back people who take everything in good humour, but one thing they do not appreciate is being heckled. Performing jokes onstage, after all is their job, and when they&#8217;re unable to perform their job properly due to the intervention of audience members, they can get quite upset.</p>
<p>Case in point: Russell Brand found himself on the end of some serious aggro from one onlooker of his comedy set, and once his patience ran dry, he let rip on the heckler for disrupting his show.</p>
