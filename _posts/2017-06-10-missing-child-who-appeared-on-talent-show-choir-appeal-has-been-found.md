<p>Last Saturday saw the last episode of the 11th series of Britain&#8217;s Got Talent. The talent show has been around since 2007, and this edition&#8217;s final saw 11 talents square off for the title of 2017&#8217;s most talented British act. Vocalist group the Missing People Choir eventually finished eighth in the voting as the pianist Tokio Meyers took home the prize, but the group will enjoy quite a heartwarming consolation prize.</p>

<p>During their final performance, the Missing People Choir displayed a list of missing persons across the United Kingdom on the stage above them, and appealed for their safe return. They may not have won Britain&#8217;s Got Talent, but it has since emerged that a 13-year-old boy who appeared on the screen that day has been found and safely returned to his grateful family.</p>
