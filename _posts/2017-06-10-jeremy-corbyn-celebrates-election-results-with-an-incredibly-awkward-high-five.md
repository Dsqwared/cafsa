<p>He&#8217;s not always had the best of times as leader of the Labour Party, but Jeremy Corbyn will have woken up today and felt pretty good about the work he&#8217;s done so far. Elected as Labour&#8217;s leader in September of 2015 following the resignation of Ed Miliband, Corbyn faced an uphill struggle to gain the approval of the party, with 172 of his MPs passing a vote of no confidence in the Islington North MP, after the EU referendum in June 2016.</p>

<p>After a snap election called by Prime Minister Theresa May, the Labour Party clawed back parliamentary seats on the Conservatives, leading to a hung parliament and boosting Corbyn&#8217;s hopes of becoming Prime Minister. In the early hours of Friday morning, Jeremy Corbyn celebrated in London with fellow Islington MP Emily Thornberry, but an attempted high five might put a dampener on Corbyn&#8217;s post-vote festivities.</p>
